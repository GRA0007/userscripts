# ðŸŒ» Benji's Userscripts

Hi welcome to my collection of userscripts I've created over the years. Previously these have been hosted directly on [Greasyfork](https://greasyfork.org/en/users/4072-benjamin-grant), but I've decided to migrate them over to Github.

## Scripts

For more details on each script, see specific READMEs in `/scripts/<script-name>`.

| Name | Description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| [Smoothroll](./scripts/smoothroll) | Clean crunchyroll viewing experience |
| [Twitch Auto Dark Mode](./scripts/twitch-auto-dark-mode) | Sync Twitch dark theme with your system color scheme |
| [Pulp No Overscroll](./scripts/pulp-no-overscroll) | Prevent overscroll on mac when using the scroll wheel to emulate the crank in the Playdate Pulp web player |
| [Harvest Time Tracker Simplifier](./scripts/harvest-time-tracker-simplifier) | Hide the header and footer for a simple tracking experience |
| [Web Archive Save Link](./scripts/web-archive-save-link) | Adds a save button to web archive pages |


## Using a script

To use a script you'll first need to install the [Tampermonkey browser extension](https://www.tampermonkey.net/) to your browser.

Then, click install on the extension you want through [Greasyfork](https://greasyfork.org/en/users/4072-benjamin-grant). By installing from Greasyfork, you'll automatically get updates to the script.

### Arc browser

If you're using [Arc](https://arc.net/), you can still install using the method above (recommended), however if you want, you can copy all of the userscript you'd like directly into an Arc boost. You'll need to choose the "inject" template when creating the boost.

Note that currently, if you copy the code across into a boost rather than using Tampermonkey, you won't receive automatic updates.
